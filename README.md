# Horses on Horse Shoes

After cloning the repo:

```
cd Horses_on_Horse_Shoes
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

And then run the Rails server: `rails s`

Once we start using React with this project you will also want to run the webpack dev server in another WSL tab: `bin/webpack-dev-server`
